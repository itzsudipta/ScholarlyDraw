## üéØ Overview

This project is an **advanced, AI-powered web application** that translates natural language descriptions into complete, compilable, and professional-quality LaTeX diagrams using the TikZ library. Developed as part of an IBM internship program, this tool leverages a modern, cloud-native tech stack to provide a seamless and intuitive user experience.

The application features a **conversational chatbot interface** where users can describe complex diagrams, such as system architectures, flowcharts, and neural networks, and receive ready-to-use LaTeX code in real-time.

## ‚ú® Features

üó£Ô∏è **Conversational UI**: An intuitive chatbot interface for describing diagrams

üß† **Natural Language to Code**: Converts plain English descriptions into precise TikZ code

üìÑ **Full Document Generation**: Creates complete, runnable `.tex` files, including preambles and necessary packages

üîß **Advanced Prompt Engineering**: Utilizes a robust prompt structure to ensure the AI defines custom styles and follows LaTeX syntax rules, minimizing errors

‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud-Native Deployment**: Fully containerized and deployed on IBM's scalable cloud infrastructure

## üõ†Ô∏è Professional Tech Stack

This project was built using a **professional-grade, end-to-end technology stack**, demonstrating expertise in modern AI and cloud development.

```

## üöÄ Deployment

The application is deployed as a **containerized web service** on IBM Code Engine.

### Deployment Pipeline

1. **Source Code**: The application code is hosted in a GitHub repository
2. **Containerization**: A Dockerfile defines the environment, installing all dependencies and setting up the Gunicorn production server
3. **Cloud Build & Deploy**: IBM Code Engine automatically pulls the source code from GitHub, builds the Docker image, and deploys it as a live application
4. **Secure Configuration**: API keys and Project IDs are managed securely as environment variables within the Code Engine deployment, not hardcoded in the source

### Environment Variables

```bash
LATEX=your_ibm_watsonx_api_key
PROJECT_ID=your_ibm_project_id
```

## üì¶ Installation & Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Docker (for containerized deployment)
- IBM watsonx.ai API credentials

### Local Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scholarly-draw.git
   cd scholarly-draw
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirement.txt
   ```

3. **Set environment variables**
   ```bash
   set LATEX=your_api_key
   set PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the application**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

### Docker Deployment

1. **Build the Docker image**
   ```bash
   docker build -t scholarly-draw .
   ```

2. **Run the container**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 -e LATEX=your_api_key -e PROJECT_ID=your_project_id scholarly-draw
   ```

## üé® Usage Examples

### Example 1: Flowchart
**Input**: "Create a flowchart showing the software development lifecycle"

**Output**: Complete LaTeX document with TikZ flowchart

### Example 2: Neural Network
**Input**: "Draw a simple neural network with 3 input nodes, 2 hidden layers, and 1 output node"

**Output**: Professional TikZ neural network diagram

### Example 3: System Architecture
**Input**: "Design a microservices architecture diagram with API gateway, databases, and load balancer"

**Output**: Comprehensive system architecture in LaTeX
